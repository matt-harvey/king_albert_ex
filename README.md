# KingAlbertEx

A command-line implementation of the single-player card game
[King Albert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Albert_%28solitaire%29)
in Elixir.

# Installing

It's not published as a Hex package at this point.
To install, clone this git repo, make sure you have Elixir installed,
and run `mix escript.build` within the repo. This will build an executable
called `king_albert_ex`. Run `./king_albert_ex` to play the game.

# TODO

* Publish as a hex package
* CI
